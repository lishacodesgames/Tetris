## Overview
This is a simple, minimal game of Tetris implemented in Raylib, C++ with OOP. <br>
I made this game to practice Raylib with the crutches of a tutorial, but while trying to do as much as I can myself. <br>
It has Raylib as a submodule, thus there are no external dependencies. <br>

## Running cmake build
* With vscode: Just run it by selecting preset (Debug for details, Release for efficiency)
* With terminal: <br>
```
cmake --preset Debug
cmage --build --preset Debug
```
Or replace with "Release" or whatever else preset you'd like to add.

Simple :D
