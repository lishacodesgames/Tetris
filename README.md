# Raylib Tetris
Plain tetris in C++ with a slimmed (by me) Raylib submodule (not by me)

## Running cmake
* With vscode: Just run it by selecting preset (Debug for details, Release for efficiency)
* With terminal: <br>
```
cmake --preset Debug
cmage --build --preset Debug
```
Or replace with "Release" or whatever else preset you'd like to add.
<br>

Simple :D
