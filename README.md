## Overview
This is a simple, minimal game of Tetris implemented in Raylib, C++ with OOP. <br>
I made this game to practice Raylib with the crutches of a tutorial, but while trying to do as much as I can myself. <br>
It has Raylib as a submodule, thus there are no external dependencies. <br>

## Running cmake build
* Presets: Debug for details, Release for efficiency
* &nbsp; Builds Tetris executable in build\Debug or build\Release
* With terminal (configure, then build): <br>
```
cmake --preset Debug (or Release)
cmake --build --preset Debug (or Release)
```
* Or if you've got vscode and the cmake tools extension installed: <br>
&nbsp; 1. `ctrl/cmd + Shift + P` to open commands panel at the top <br>
&nbsp; 2. `CMake: Select Configure Preset` <br>
&nbsp; 3. `CMake: Configure` (usually vscode does this automatically once your preset is selected) <br>
&nbsp; 4. `CMake: Build` or `CMake: Build Target` <br>

Simple :D
